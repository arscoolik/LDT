We are three MIPT students, studying for the third year. We thought to ourselves. Who can do it better? Us three or a team of proffesionals. So we decided that they know what they are doing. We decided to use pickpoints postamat location for a several reasons:
1. There is an ability on their website to download an .xls file with all the locations and we didn't have to parse everything automatically.
2. OZON fired me as a Backend developer, so we don't support them as a company.
3. Yandex has some flaws in their work with several accounts.

On their website there is already a map with all the filters needed. And in the file postamats.xls are all the locations.
